            reviews to interactive maps, BeavsHub puts everything you need in
            one place.

          </h3>
          <p>
            I'm a Computer Science student at Oregon State University,
            passionate about making tech that actually helps people. I created
            BeavsHub as a way to give back to the community thatâ€™s shaped my
            experience today â€” and to make your journey a little smoother along
            the way.
